// FilmSpec / Scene / Beat — the top-level film schema shape.
//
// **Forward-compat by design**: this file declares the SHAPE every film
// honours but is intentionally *blind* to per-scene-type fields. The kit
// never knows what fields a `mechanism` scene has, or a `walkthrough`. Each
// `ScenePlugin` contributes its own JSON Schema fragment and TS shape; the
// engine unions them at runtime via `Engine.schema()`.
//
// What lives here:
//   - `FilmSpec` — top-level shape with `meta`, `scenes`, optional `style`,
//     optional `tts`.
//   - `Scene` — discriminated by `type: string`. The `type` is the only
//     required field the kit knows about; everything else is plugin-owned.
//   - `Beat` — minimum-viable beat shape (id, narration, optional set/transform
//     directives). Scene plugins can refine the beat type they consume via
//     their `resolveBeat` hook.
//   - `FilmMeta` — the rendering-shape constants (id, title, duration,
//     resolution) the engine itself reads.
//
// Per the strategy doc §11.5: "the film spec JSON top-level shape" is
// CLOSED. Plugins add scene-type branches, not top-level keys.
