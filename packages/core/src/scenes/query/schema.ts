// JSON Schema fragment for the `query` scene's per-type spec branch.
//
// The `query` scene's native shape IS the observability primitive every
// lunch-and-learn on PromQL / LogQL / SQL / Jaeger query / KQL needs but
// no existing docent scene can render: a query being progressively
// typed/built next to a live result that evolves with it. Closeup is for
// source listings, not query DSLs; passage is for prose, not code; chart
// renders a curve but never the SQL behind it. This scene is the missing
// observability primitive.
//
// The split-pane layout is fixed: the query editor on the left (60% width)
// and the result panel on the right (40% width). Beats progressively
// reveal lines via `revealId` (a per-line opaque marker pulled into
// `beat.reveal`) and drive the result value via the existing `beat.set`
// directive — the same tween grammar `quantities` metrics ride.
